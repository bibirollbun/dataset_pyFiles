# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session


# ライブラリのインポート
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# データ読み込み
df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/playground-series-s4e8/test.csv')

# 最初の5行を表示
print(df.head())


# データセットの行数と列数を確認
print(f"{df.shape[0]}行, {df.shape[1]}列")

# データ全体の情報確認
print(df.info())

# 欠損値の表示
print(df.isnull().sum())
